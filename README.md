# dgrp_advanced-mcdonaldsjob

## Please Note! 
This version of my Mcdonalds Job is NOT working! I have been trying for over a month to get it working correctly and am unable to, I've been seeking help on the community for about a month with barely even a response. So I'm leaving this here Broken and unworking for someone else to hopefully be able to fix.. as I am no longer going to waste my time on it, with many requests comining in for the simple version, I do not wish to work on 2 seperate projects.. so enjoy.. same deal. don't bother trying to steal this addon and claim it as your own work, because I have given up on it. if you find a fix let me know and I can continue to work on it and finish it.
